        <p style="color:white; text-align: center;">As our new students go through the annual rite of welcome, we ask you to reach out and offer additional words of comfort, support and advice. It always helps to get a note from someone who's been there before&mdash;someone who knows just what it's like to be a part of The Xavier Experience.</p>
